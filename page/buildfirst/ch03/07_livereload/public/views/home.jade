                # LiveReload

                Enabling LiveReload, the browser technology that does browser refreshing for us, couldn't be easier. We just need an extra target in our `watch` task. Something like this will do the trick:

                ```js
                livereload: {
                  options: {
                    livereload: true
                  },
                  files: [
                    'build/**/*'
                  ]
                }
                ```

                We then need to install the browser extension. [Instructions](http://feedback.livereload.com/knowledgebase/articles/86242) can be found here. Once we did both those things, it will just be a matter of following along a few simple steps.

                - Visit `http://localhost:3000/`
                - Remember to enable the browser extension, by clicking on it
                - Change something in the `public` directory
                - Wait for the build to complete
                - Watch in astonishment how your browser refreshes itself.
