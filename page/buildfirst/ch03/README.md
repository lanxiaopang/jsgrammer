# Environments and the Development Workflow

##### _(Part I, Chapter 3)_

In this chapter we cover **environments, build distributions, and continuous development** using Grunt. These are the samples as discussed through the chapter, in the same order of appearance.

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.
