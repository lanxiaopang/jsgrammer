# Introduction to Build Processes

##### _(Part I, Chapter 1)_

Well, _hello there!_ You've arrived at the directory for the code samples in the first chapter of the book.

This chapter is pretty code-light, and it's supposed to be! It's just the introductory chapter. Don't worry, [the next chapter][1] makes up for that, with **tons of code samples** for you to look at!

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.
