# Context Scoping

One of the most challenging tasks we have to undertake in our quest to become expert JavaScripters is developing an understanding of _how scoping works_, [how to manipulate the `this` keyword][6], and actually being able to tell what the value of `this` will be in a given call stack. In section `5.1.3` we talk about scopes, `this`, the `.apply`, `.call`, and `.bind` methods, as well as the `new` operator.

## [Call, Apply, Bind][3]

- `Function.prototype.call` takes any number of arguments, the first one is assigned to `this`, and the rest are passed as arguments to the function that's being invoked.

- `Function.prototype.apply` behaves very similarly to `.call`, but it takes the arguments as a single array with every value, instead of any number of parameter values.

- `Function.prototype.bind` creates a special function which can be used to invoke the function it is called on. That function will always use the `this` argument passed to `.bind`, as well as being able to assign a few arguments, creating a curried version of the original function.

## Currying with `.bind`

The `.bind` method can also be used to produce what's called a _curried_ function. Currying is one of the most powerful aspects of functional programming, allowing you to _"pre-apply"_ one or more arguments to a method. For example, you could pre-apply some arguments of a function in multiple ocassions, producing slightly different functions with pre-applied values. Here's an example.

```js
function somethingIsSomewhere (what, where) {
  return 'The ' + what + ' is ' + where;
}

var fox = somethingIsSomewhere.bind(null, 'big brown fox');
var duckInABox = somethingIsSomewhere.bind(null, 'brownish duck', 'sitting in a box');

fox('hiding behind the bushes');
// <- 'The big brown fox is hiding behind the bushes'

duckInABox();
// <- 'The brownish duck is sitting in a box'
```

## That `strict` mode

If our code is running in strict mode, then `this` will default to `undefined`, instead of `Window`. Outside of strict mode, `this` is always an object: the provided object if called with an object reference; its boxed representation if called with a primitive boolean, string, or numeric value; or the global object (again, `undefined` under strict mode) if called with either `undefined` or `null`. The value passed as `this` to a function in strict mode isn't boxed into an object.

You can read more about **strict mode** [_inside the book_][5], and MDN also has [a nice write-up on the subject][8] you might want to check out!

## Order Matters

JavaScript variables fill the scope in the order described below.

- Scope context variables: `this`, and `arguments`
- Named function parameters: `function (these, variable, names)`
- Function expressions: `function something () {}`
- Local scope variables: `var foo`
