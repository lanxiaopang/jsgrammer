    Angular.js uses declarative markup to extend HTML, creating our views.
    HTML attributes are often used to map to directives, Angular's form of
    interaction with the DOM, which helps us abstract the interaction so it
    can be easily tested. The `ng-app` attribute is one of many of the markup
    extensions Angular offers, and is required to indicate what the root scope
    of our application is, and what Angular module it maps to.

    We will go deeper into controllers in Angular in Chapter 7, and for now it
    should suffice to say that controllers are meant to tie everything toegether.
    By everything, we're talking about services, Angular scopes, and scope watchers,
    among other features.

  <!--
      Angular works differently from what we just saw in RequireJS. Rather than act as
      a module loader, Angular just worries about our dependency graph. Thus, we need
      to add a script tag for each file we're using, unlike AMD which dealt with that for us.
      However, in the case of Angular we see an interesting behavior where script order isn't
      really all that relevant. As long as we have Angular on top, and then the script which
      declares our module, the rest of the scripts can be in whatever order we want, and Angular
      will deal with that for us.

      These could actually be in any order!
