    RequireJS uses a data-main attribute to indicate the first script to load.
    In async mode, the rest will be fetched as they get resolved. When using
    the optimizer to bundle everything together, this pattern will be useful
    just to learn the order in which the dependency graph should be put together
    into a single file. This way, we don't have to worry about ordering script
    tags, like we do in the classical approach of just adding a script tag for
    each script we write.
