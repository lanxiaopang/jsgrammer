# Minify Task

![minify-js.png][1]

This example shows how to configure the Uglify Grunt task, as discussed in Chapter 2 of the book.

In the example, we'll be setting up minification for a JS file. When we run it, the file will be minified and placed into a `build/` directory.

To run this example, enter the following command in your terminal.

```shell
grunt uglify:js
```
