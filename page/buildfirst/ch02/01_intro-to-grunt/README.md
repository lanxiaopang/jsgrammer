Grunt.js is a _JavaScript Task Runner_ we'll be using throughout the book to help us hatch a build process. To install Grunt, do:

```shell
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

This example contains the bare minimum required to execute a lint task through Grunt. You could just run `grunt jshint` in your command-line. Below is a screenshot of the expected output.
