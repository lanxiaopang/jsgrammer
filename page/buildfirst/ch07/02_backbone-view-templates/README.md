# Backbone View Templates

[![backbone.png][1]][2]

It might be hard for you to eye-parse this example without walking through the introductory materials on [Backbone][2] in Chapter 7 first, so I suggest you read about MVC and [Backbone][2] in the book before going through this example.

To run this example you'll need to build the application with Browserify, I've set up Grunt for that, just like in [**ch05e11** Browserify + Common.JS][4].

```shell
grunt build
```

Once you build it, you can see it in action just opening the HTML page. Make sure you browse through the code! I'm sure you'll find **interesting comments and advice** in there!

```shell
open app.html
```

Oh, also, if you want to make changes to the Backbone application, and rebuild them without runing `grunt build` every time, you could use the following command.

```
grunt watch
```

That's about it. This demo shows how you can use Backbone to render a view in your HTML using [Mustache][5] templates. I've kept this example simple on purpose, so that you can progressively understand what is going on as we add functionality to the view.
