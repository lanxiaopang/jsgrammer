# Modular Model View Controller in the Browser

##### _(Part II, Chapter 7)_

In this chapter, the focus is on **modular application building**, with a twist. Rather than focus on how to organize our files themselves, which we've already discussed at length in [Chapter 5][1], I'll focus on organization at the application level. We'll learn all about the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, and how to apply it in JavaScript code. In particular, how to apply it in client-side JavaScript. You'll get a good look at the [Backbone][3] library, which is a popular foundation for developing complex MVC applications, and later you'll be able to bring that to the server-side, using a library called [Rendr][4]. These are the samples as discussed through the chapter, in the same order of appearance.

All samples are self-contained, ready to use, and sensibly documented.
