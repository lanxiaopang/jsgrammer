# Your First `tape` Test!

Writing JavaScript unit tests honestly isn't that hard, and `tape` makes it even easier! It's pretty well documented as well, so you might want to [take a look at its documentation][1] to better understand how to customize your unit testing experience.

To run the tests by hand, simply execute `node` in your terminal, like below.

```shell
node test/compute
```
