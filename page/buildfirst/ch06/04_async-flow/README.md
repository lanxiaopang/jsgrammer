# Asynchronous Flow Control

Using a flow control library makes things much easier for you. These examples demonstrate uses of both `async.parallel` and `async.series`. They execute a series of tasks concurrently and sequentially, respectively.

In these examples, I am using the [async][1] flow control library.
